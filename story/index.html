      <h2 class='storybook__line'>Alejandra was born in the Sunshine State, among sand and surf.</h2>
      <p class='storybook__text'>The first time my mother saw me, she called me <em>Chispa</em>, or “little spark” in Spanish. That moniker not only stuck, but also may have had a hand in determining my fate. My existence has been anything but ordinary.</p>

        <h2 class='storybook__line'>Above all else, she's always been a dreamer.</h2>
        <p class='storybook__text'>I consider myself lucky. As a kid, I looked to the outdoors as my sole source of entertainment, learning, and wisdom. Mimicking my carpenter father, I built things from random supplies and objects around my home including a fort, a sled for my dog to pull me around on, and a bug palace for the resident roly polies. Despite the sometimes gross nature of my leisure activities, they allowed me to develop an entrepreneurial spirit. I am always dreaming, doing, innovating.</p>

        <h2 class='storybook__line'>She is always evolving and adapting.</h2>
        <p class='storybook__text'>My background is unique and varied for many reasons, the most important of which is that I am hungry for knowledge. Insatiable, really.</p>
        <p class='storybook__text'>I have been everything from a legal assistant to a biologist (my degree is in Interdisciplinary Zoological Sciences) to an artist to a molecular gastronomist to a triathlete, to now, a designer. I am a researcher at heart, and am never satisfied until I get to the bottom of something. I am relentless.</p>
        <p class='storybook__text'>Working on the web is the perfect place for me to seek nourishment, because the internet is always growing, changing, evolving – and I am too, right along with it.</p>

        <h2 class='storybook__line'>She laughs fear in the face.</h2>
        <p class='storybook__text'>I bought a one-way ticket to Chicago last year after living my entire life in Florida. I used to play with alligators and <a href="/images/snake-wrangler.jpg">venomous snakes</a> for fun (and for work). I’ve engaged in passionate debates with clients about the shittiness of requiring binary gender choice in their forms. I guess you could say I’m practically fearless.</p>

      <h2 class='storybook__line'>She is okay being the little fish in a big pond.</h2>
      <p class='storybook__text'>I think inexperience is a great thing. When it comes to building a product, I shed my ego and pretend I'm new at this; approaching things with curiosity and optimism. Workplaces that encourage growth (through both learning and teaching) are my jam.</p>
      <p class='storybook__text'>My goal is to advocate for users and win hearts and minds for a cause I’m passionate about. You can't teach that.</p>

        <h2 class='backCover__heading'>who are you?</h2>
        <p class='backCover__text'>Well, if you hadn’t gleaned from the text above, I’m Alejandra Luaces-Riera. It’s okay if you can’t pronounce it on the first try. I moved to Chicago from Florida a year and a half ago. I’m currently a user experience & visual designer at Table XI, but looking for my next work-home. Check out my <a href="http://dribbble.com/alejandraluaces">dribbble</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/alejandraluaces">twitter</a>, or check out my <a href="/images/resume.pdf">resume</a> if you are so inclined.</p>
      </div>
      <div class='l--half backCover__block'>
        <h2 class='backCover__heading'>but table xi is great!</h2>
        <p class='backCover__text'>Yes, I agree! However, it’s getting to be a bit tough iterating on other people’s dreams, sending them off into the wild, and never hearing from them again. Table XI is a great place to work and grow (and they're my family!), but the work isn’t the right fodder for my soul.</p>

        <h2 class='backCover__heading'>what is this about?</h2>
        <p class='backCover__text'>Children’s stories inspire me. There's something about the innocence, the whimsical nature, the gentleness of them. I wanted to tell a story about myself modeled after a children’s story. I wanted it to feel ethereal. I wanted it to inspire a sense of wonder, while delivering relevant information about what I bring to the table, both professionally and personally. I also wanted to use this as a playground where I could test out new new front-end technologies.</p>

      <div class='l--half backCover__block'>
        <h2 class='backCover__heading'>why product design?</h2>
        <p class='backCover__text'>I’ve been focusing on product design for the entirety of my career in tech. I love what I do. For my restless mind, product design is a great focus. Product design encompasses all the things I love most: from writing copy that inspires curiosity, to assembling a consistent, fun visual design system, to crafting modular, graceful code. I love being able to touch every step of the process.</p>
